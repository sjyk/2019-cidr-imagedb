\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
Images and video are the frontier of modern data management.
The growing maturity of neural networks for image prediction and segmentation problems has made visual analytics an attractive and inter-discplinary field of study.
We explored the intersection of these neural network models and data management by designing a query processing engine called \textsf{DeepLens}.
